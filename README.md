TimeZoned
================

NOTE: WORK IN PROGRESS - NOT USABLE YET

A high-level time zone package for Meteor. Aims to have the same simple API on client and server. Currently uses The Google Time Zone API for time zone geolocation and moment-timezone for `Date` handling, but could be adapted to support configurable data sources. Pull requests and issues are welcome.
